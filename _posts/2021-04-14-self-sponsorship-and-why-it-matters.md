title: Self Sponsorship and Why It Matters

description: We may not have anyone in an organisation that has our back or actively sponsors and champions us. This can hurt our chances of promotion and progress, so we need to defend ourselves.

I've been in tech 15 years and I've yet to have a manager that really 'gets it' that genuinely wants to foster my skills, help me grow and champion me in an organisation. Regardless of the wide and varying situations that lead to our neglect this leads to a situation where we don't know our value, don't feel proud of ourselves, don't feel seen and our managers also don't see our value or progress.

At the very least if our managers won't actively help us grow, we still need them to sponsor us upwards and be aware of our successes so that we can progress.

## What is 'Sponsorship'?

There's an excellent image from [Better Allies](https://twitter.com/betterallies) that beautifully encapsulates what sponsorship means.

This is what our managers _should_ be doing. I go out of my way to make sure I'm doing it for every single one of my marginalised direct reports and if you're a manager and not doing it, take a long hard look at yourself and start doing it _right now_.

## What is 'Self Sponsorship'?

Self sponsorship is about owning _our_ career, owning _our_ situation and making positive changes towards getting _ourselves_ to where _we_ want to be.

It's easy to fall into the trap of thinking that we have no control over the situation we find ourselves in and that we will never be seen and valued, or worse we don't deserve to be seen! But we DO have the power in our own hands to make positive changes to the way we are perceived at work. It will take time and effort and energy but it WILL get us to a better place, regardless of the environment and our manager.

Now to most of us it's going to feel weird because we're going to have to own our achievements and feel like we are worth something and this is challenging. There's some practical steps you can start taking today that can get you on the path of being seen and feeling valued, even by yourself as a first step.

## Step 1. State Your Intentions

Before you start this process, decide what it is you want. Is it a 5k pay rise, is it a new job role, whatever it is decide on it then book in specific time with your manager for a chat that goes along the lines of 'By next year, I would like to be on £5k more. To help me achieve this, I want to agree goals with you that will help me get there.' Ensure you get SMART objectives on the back of this that you feel you can actually achieve. Generate some ideas in advance of the meeting that seem realistic and be clear in the specific support you expect from your manager or the business.

'I want to be an engineering manager by next year. To do this, I'd like to take on 2 line reports with support from the Head of Engineering. I've spoken with her and she would be happy to coach me, but I need your help to decide who I should manage and when'. Anything you can do to ease the situation and get buy in from you manager with as little help from them as possible will be in your favour.

By doing this, you've agreed with your manager what success looks like and you're going to be logging _every day_, _every week_, _every quarter_ and _every year_ your progress towards this. You can tailor your 'wins' based on the outcomes you have agreed.

There may be a situation where you state an intention that can't be satisfied, like a promotion. If that's the case at least you know where you stand and can perhaps reach a compromise, but you've at least opened up a conversation.

## Step 2. Write Down Your Achievements Every Single Day

At the end of the day, I write some quick bullet points in a document I call 'Work Log 2021' or whatever the year happens to be. These are super light touch but cover what I delivered, what I learned, what was challenging or anything else that was interesting during my day.

These are very quick, unsanitized notes just for me to look back on.

### Example: Work Log

Feb 15th
- Caught up with HR re: the performance management of employee X
- Wrote up 360 review and made a plan for employee Y's next one to one to action it
- Gave employee Z some guidance about how we approach CSS in the codebase

Feb 16th
- Attended weekly brief meeting and flagged that making our own cookie banner would not be trivial
- Helped get an issue employee A was having through product support, got it fixed in record time thanks to the reduced build time
- Shared my summary of Humble Inquiry in the learning channel

If nothing else this helps me be able to update folks on what I've been working on should they ask, because I have a memory like a sieve.

The last entry of the week can be a good time to reflect on what you've been up to and where you are spending your time. When you start to really look at what you do every week it can become obvious that a lot of your time is spent on activities that don't serve you or don't give you energy.

## Step 3. Make a 'Wins of the X' Topic Every Single One to One

No matter the cadence of your one to ones, always make space to update your manager on the wins you've had since the last time you spoke. Wins of the week, wins of the weeks, wins of the month whatever fits your one to one cycle.

This is where rewriting your log comes in. We want to take those items and focus them on the _business impact_ of each item.

### Example: Wins of the Week

Wins of the Week
- Increased output of the sales team by unblocking a product support ticket in record time.
- Increased team output by reducing the site build speed.
- Saved us time and money by stopping us writing our own cookie banner and providing a low cost 3rd party tool.

This is a great way to acknowledge for yourself just _how much you do_! I can almost guarantee when you start to capture it you'll be stunned at how amazing and productive you are and the volume of learning you do without even realising it.

## Step 4. Make a 'Wins of the Quarter / Year' Summary to Share With Your Manager

Regardless of whether they want to see it or not, at the end of the quarter and the end of the year book in time with your manager to talk through a high level summary of your wins of the quarter and year.

Keep this light, 1 page max, because you'll struggle to hold their attention otherwise. Choose your biggest successes, the things you are most proud of are really shout about it.

You might want to break these up into sections like line management, technical work and so on.

### Example: Wins of the Year

Technical Work: what do we have now that we didn’t last year?
- Won a critical business project by architecting and project managing a white label solution of the app under budget and ahead of time.
- Increased developer productivity due to decreasing build time of the app by 80%.
- Easier to use self serve business reporting through setting up BigQuery.

Line Management: what's different now that we didn't do last year?
- A motivated and delivering team in a pandemic, delivering at our highest velocity so far with minimised toxic behaviour and reset healthier culture.
- Motivated and engaged engineers with personal development plans rolled out for self directed learning.
- Team capacity bolstered by 3 new engineers hired within a month, able to ship code within their first week due to new onboarding process and buddy system.

You can use this document to reflect on where you started, where you've been and where you're going to go next in your personal growth. What was the biggest challenge, the biggest surprise, the best thing you learned?

I always feel so, so proud when I write up my wins and that's a really powerful thing for self esteem. If you don't value yourself, how is anyone else going to?
## Questions to Ask Your Manager

Based on the knowledge that our managers probably don't really know what sponsorship is, we want to prompt them and educate them about what we need. If you want to, you could show them the better allies poster up there that I linked and say you want to talk about it.

Even if you don't share it you can ask things like:
- When was the last time you mentioned my name when I'm not around, to champion me to your superiors?
- Do you share messages in Slack (or other text tool) about what I have accomplished?
- Could you invite me to the next board meeting so I can learn what it's like?
- What do you think the chances are of me getting promoted, is the CEO on board with it?
- Is there anything you can delegate to me as a stretch assignment?

It's important to say 'when was the last time' rather than 'do you ever' because it means they need to give you a very concrete response and can't just say 'yeah, sure'.

## Time to Move On

If you try the steps here and you get constantly ignored and you have done everything you possibly can to sponsor yourself, it may be time to think about finding a new job. The great news is you've been chronicling your wins constantly for the last year so when it comes to brushing up your CV and preparing for competency questions you have _got this_.

## For Bonus Points

It's good to be seen as much as you can, so if your company has a slack channel where you can show off your work _use it_! It feels weird and 'egotistical' to a lot of us but it's such a great way to get exposure. Similarly any chance to showcase your work in company meetings or presentations. I know it's scary but it'll go a long way towards getting you seen.

Try to do the same for your colleagues, shout about their wins and you'll soon find they start doing the same thing for you.

## Summary

We are very unlikely to work in perfect conditions with superhero managers that put us and our needs and our growth and well-being first. Through the power of self sponsorship we can start to value ourselves more, be more seen and help our managers understand our needs and our value. You have the power to make positive changes for yourself, starting with owning your own achievements and giving yourself some well deserved recognition.
