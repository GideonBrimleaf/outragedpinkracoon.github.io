Scenario: Youâ€™ve started a new project for the first time in a while and you go to check what your site looks like by using the Chrome inspect tab. Surprisingly the text appears really small like this:

Fix: We need to add the meta viewport tag to the head.

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no" />
```

MDN have an excellent article you can read about [why this is the case](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag).
