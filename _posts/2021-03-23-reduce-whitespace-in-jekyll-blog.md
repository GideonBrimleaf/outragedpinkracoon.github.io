I noticed today in this very blog that I had an extra space between the comma and the tag names on my posts:

![weird spacing on comma and tags](/assets/images/jekyll-space-1.png)

It got weirder still, because when I opened the inspect window I saw this extra whitespace in the html:

![extra whitespace in html](/assets/images/jekyll-space-3.png)

Turns out, when you use the squiggle bracket to evaluate content (see below), it will render a new line _even if it evaluates false_.

To fix this, we need to insert a '-' character beside the closing and opening brackets.

This stops the rendering of the extra whitespace:
