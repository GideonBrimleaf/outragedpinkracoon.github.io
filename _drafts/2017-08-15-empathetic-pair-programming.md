EMPATHETIC PAIR PROGRAMMING
Pair programming isn’t easy. It’s a skill to learn, much like everything else we do in software development. Working with people is challenging, and working closely together 8 hours a day, 5 days a week even more so.

I haven’t got any science to back me up, but from my own observations it’s more likely than not that when you put 2 developers together that have never paired together before that there will be some tensions and in the worst case it will be a horrible experience, rather than everything being all butterflies and rainbows.

However, if we are going to spend the bulk of our day pairing with another person, we want it to be as pleasant and productive as possible and it takes a bit of work and empathy to get there.

We need to be aware that the person we are pairing with has wants and needs, and these may not match up to those that we hold personally. This can lead to frictions and be quite an exhausting experience if we are not mindful of it.

BE HONEST IF YOU DON’T FEEL LIKE PAIRING
Some days, we can be in a total funk and want to put our headphones on and pretend the rest of the world doesn’t exist. This a totally cool and normal human way to feel. It’s a horrible experience to be forced to pair with someone who really isn’t up for it and similarly horrible to be made to pair when you really are not in the headspace for it.

It’s important to be honest about this and tell your team mates that you want some time alone. Choose some appropriate tickets to work solo on and pair again when you feel like it. Otherwise both parties will have a miserable experience anyway.

PUT YOURSELF IN THEIR SHOES
We need to put ourselves in the other person’s shoes from time to time to ensure they are getting just as much out of the session as we are. This is particularly important when pairing with more junior developers, who may feel intimidated or shy and be afraid of speaking up when they are lost / confused.

At the start of a new pairing session, you might want to ask yourself questions like:

Are both parties up to speed with the project background and context?
Is one of the pairs likely to feel intimidated / scared / shy or be causing such an effect on the other unintentionally through perceived seniority etc?
Are both parties happy with which machine will be used and the setup? Is time needed to get up to speed with a new environment / editor etc?
Will you be taking regular breaks? If so when?
Do they finish work earlier than you do?
How do they approach project task management? Is it totally different to your approach?
What is their coding style and how does it differ to you?
Is there anything that either party is worried about regarding the pairing session and working together?
A short chat at the start of a pairing session to cover these sort of things and get them out in the open can be the difference between a terrible time you never wish to repeat and a really enjoyable pairing session.

TAKE TURNS TO DRIVE
Pairing shouldn’t be a passive activity for either party – both should be actively involved and feel like they are contributing. Whether this means adopting the ‘driver / navigator’ approach or doing something looser, each person should feel engaged in the activity.

It can be useful when a pair are getting to know each other to have a set agreement for when to switch driver. Every 15 minutes, every hour whatever you feel suits between you.

As you get to know each other, this will become more intuitive. Often you can learn to detect when you pair is lost / confused / getting tired and it’s a good time to step in. Never grab the keyboard and demand to take over though, be gentle about it.

ENJOY HAVING A SOUNDING BOARD
If you are in the driving seat, be sure not to get lost in your own little world and go off and do the work while the other person just sits and watches. The beauty of pairing is that you can collaborate and come up with ideas that are often much better than what you could have come up with alone. Use their ideas!  They will make you question what you are doing and why and often justify your reasoning.

It can help the other person to keep engaged and on track if you expose your inner monologue and explain up front what you are trying to achieve. Really, if you have the ideas the other person ought to be typing so that they remain engaged but there might be times where it works better to also be fleshing it out yourself with their contributions. Be sure not to do this for too long a period though, lest they become bored and disengaged.

LET THE NEWCOMER TYPE
If someone is new to a piece of work and joining you, it can really help to build their confidence if they do the bulk of the typing at first. This has several benefits for them:

Navigate the project structure to learn where files and folders are
Navigating the code to get a feel for how it hangs together
Feeling actively involved and engaged from the get go
Sitting passively while you watch the expert can be boring, confusing and unhelpful. It can also lead to the person who knows the background and wrote the code to go very quickly and bamboozle the newcomer. This approach forces the expert to slow down, explain their reasoning and make sure the newcomer is not lost or disengaged.

EDITOR SELECTION
Editors are always a point of contention. When pairing, both parties need to be comfortable with the editor you are using. Never force your own configuration or wants and needs onto someone else – be open to using their setup.  If it’s wildly different and one of the party feels they simply can’t do it, either swap to their machine or agree on a common editor you can both be happy with.

If you need time to get used to a new editor, make this clear to your partner. If you do the driving and they teach you all of the shortcuts that you need to know this is an excellent way to get up to speed. It does require patience and empathy from the guide to let you have the time to learn and not get frustrated at the initial slow pace.

BE SPECIFIC ABOUT TIME
Pairing can be exhausting, so be sure to take regular breaks. At first it can be useful to have a regular slot e.g. once every hour until you find your rhythm. Agree how long the breaks will be and when you will be back and stick to it. This is especially important when the person you are pairing with is remote! The same applies to lunch.

Many people have after work commitments that they need to attend to, so it’s important to agree when you will finish up for the day so that both parties can be involved in any end of day tasks you might need to do.

ENJOY THE COMPANY!
People are cool. They are full of experiences, ideas and thoughts that can often surprise and delight you. The better you relax and get to know each other the more enjoyable an experience it will be. Smiling, laughing and being comfortable enough with each other that making mistakes and getting it wrong can be a bit of fun to adventure through together really makes pairing a lot easier and more enjoyable.
